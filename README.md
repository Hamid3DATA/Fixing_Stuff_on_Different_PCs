## This is just me working on my projects from different PCs, trying to fix the issues i find along.

<br />

### BlackJack
#### Problem 1
When the dealer gets an Ace card, and his points are over 21 the Ace for some reason does not count as 1 point, instead it continues to count as 11 points, which does not make sense.

### Counting
#### Problem 1
I need to find a better solution for resizing font depending on the number that is being displayed. Due to the fact that right now i have to manually type what size the font has to be in different scenarios. I would like it to be automized. Say, the width(diameter) of the "display" is 1000px then as soon as the string's length/width exceedes that amount the font should shrink till it is less than 1000px in length/width so that it stays inside the so called "display".
