## This is just me working on my projects from different PCs, trying to fix the issues i find along.

### BlackJack
#### Problem 1
When the dealer gets an Ace card, and his points are over 21 the Ace for some reason does not count as 1 point, instead it continues to count as 11 points, which does not make sense
